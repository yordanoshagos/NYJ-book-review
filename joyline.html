                The above title could be a perfect alternative title for Born a crime book by Trevor Noah.
                This is because most of the time Trevor Noah felt like an outsider. Trevor’s feeling was greatly
                influenced by his mother’s choice to break the European Immortality act to have a child with a Swiss
                man
                called Robert. Trevor was “too white” to fit in the black kids and too “too black” to fit in the
                white
                kids.Trevor fits in both categories as he could speak fluent English, Zulu, Xhosa and Africaans.

            <h3>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                subservient
                women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
            </h3>
            <p>



                Abel Ngisaveni was Patricia’s second husband, Trevor's step-father who started living with them after
                Trevor and his
                friends burned down the house of a white man while playing with a magnifying glass and matches. After
                Abel and
                Patricia got married, he became insecure of their relationship with Robert and Trevor could now not see
                his father any more. Abel wanted a woman that could be able to stand up to herself, manage a home, care
                for herself and command some respect.
                Unfortunately, when Abel saw all of this in Patricia, he began to demean her to the extent of physical
                violence.

                While gender emphasizes on gender equality and traditional expectations from the women,Patricia goes
                contrary to all of these set bars. She leaves home and trains to become a secretary for her
                oppressors.Patricia get a child with Swiss man whom he does not want to live with as she does want to be
                controlled in life. She manuevers in
                life having to fend for herself and her only child, Trevor Noah.
                Patricia’s fierce resilient nature in life is strange to Abel. Abel expects a woman who is care
                free,
                extremely submissive and who views her businesses as less important.

                In the real world, most women are encouraged to be ambitious, independent and assertive but in
                reality,
                society views this as too much or that they're violating some societal norms. Women are expected to
                strictly adhere to their gender roles while men are not. Moving forward as the society continues to
                evolve, we hope that more men and women will be empowered so as not to reflect Abel’s Mindset.
