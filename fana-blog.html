            <h4>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with 
                subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in  a cage.'”
            </h4>
            <p>The quote from a “Born a Crime”,which discusses Abel’s desire for a traditional marriage yet his
                contradiction in seeking a free woman to confine,resonates deeply with contemporary discussions
                around gender roles and relationship expectations.It reflects a contradict prevalent in many modern
                relationships where traditional ideals clash with the evolving understanding of partnership and
                equality.<br><br>
                Nowadays,there is often an expectation for women to express independence and excellence.Many men
                express a desire for strong,independent partners but at the same time uphold traditional gender
                norms that limit women’s autonomy.This leads to relationships where one partner feels forced despite
                the outward appearance of freedom.<br><br>
                In my own circle,I have seen relationships where men celebrate their partners’ achievements but
                struggle with the idea of their partner being more successful than they are.The desire for equality
                creates tension in relationships.<br><br>
                The rise of discussions around toxic manliness sheds light on how societal pressures can distort
                men’s perceptions of love and partnership.Many men are conditioned to view vulnerability as
                weakness,leading them to seek partners who fit into their preconceived notions of femininity rather
                than embracing mutual respect and partnership.</p>
                <p>Misunderstandings create distance,turning allies into adverseries,overshadowing genuine connections and leaving a longing for clarity.</p>
