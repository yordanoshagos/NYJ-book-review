                <h2> New Title: “Raised across lines”</h2>
                <p> If I could give Born a Crime a new title, I would call it "Raised Across the Lines.
                    " This title fits because Trevor Noah grew up during apartheid in South Africa, where people were
                    strictly separated by race.
                    As a mixed-race child, Trevor was literally born across the racial lines that divided society.
                    The title also reflects how he had to move between different worlds—Black, white, and colored—never
                    fully belonging to one.
                    It shows the challenges of his identity, how he had to cross social, cultural, and even language
                    barriers to survive.
                    This new title captures the heart of his story: growing up in a divided world, yet learning how to
                    adapt, understand, and find his voice.

            <p>In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah shares a powerful quote: 
                "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 
                'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'" 
                This quote speaks to the complicated way some people think about relationships, especially when it comes to gender roles and power.
                 Abel wants a traditional marriage where the woman might be expected to follow certain rules, but at the same time, he wants a strong, independent woman. 
                 The problem comes when he wants to control her freedom after they are together.

                This idea still affects many relationships today. 
                In the past, men were often expected to be the leaders in marriages,  
                
                 <span id="dots">.....</span>
                <span id="read-more-text">
                    while women were supposed to be more passive or supportive.
                    While these old-fashioned ideas have changed in many places, there are still expectations about how men and women should act. 
                     Some men say they want strong, independent women but then feel threatened by their partner’s independence once the relationship gets more serious. 
                    They might try to control their partner or limit their freedom, which creates an unhealthy dynamic.
                    In today’s world, there is more talk about equality in relationships. 
                    But sometimes, men and women still face pressure to fit certain roles. 
                    For example, some people expect men to be strong and in charge, while women are expected to be nurturing or supportive. 
                    I’ve seen how partners who start out supporting each other can end up trying to control one another.

                    Noah’s quote makes us think about how relationships should be about respect and equality, 
                    not about one person trying to control the other. It encourages us to value each other’s freedom and individuality.
