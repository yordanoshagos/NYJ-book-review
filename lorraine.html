                <h1>Rename the book: and why?</h1>
                <h3 style="color: blue;"><u>The life of a colored boy</u></h3>
                <p>I would give it this title because even though the book reflects on how Trevor’s mother lived life the way she wanted and did not follow the rules, it also reflects</p>
                <p>more on how Trevor being a coloured boy impacted his life from birth till he was a grown boy therefore it is all about the life of a colored boy.</p><br>
                <h1>Reflective Blog(300 words):</h1><br>
                <p>Born a Crime by Trevor Noah is a really good and amazing book to read and learn from. It is a book where one moment you find yourself laughing and the next</p>
                <p>moment shedding a tear and you can also find yourself just bored with it. Being my first book to ever read and finish, I honestly enjoyed it and also learned from it. I</p>
                <p>really liked how Patricia, Trevor’s mother was so bold in her ideas and knew what she wanted. She was very religious, risk-taking and so confident. I also like how Trevor</p>
                <p>was so mysterious. It was like, by  going chapter by chapter I should be expecting some new drama happening. I personally  can also relate to this book in a way where</p>
                <p>I was a colored girl in a community with black people only and the people at first looked at me and my family in a different way saying we are dolls or questioning if we</p>
                <p>are really human. So I really understood and related what Trevor was going through in a way since my whole family is colored. Patricia also reminds me of my</p>
                <p>grandmother though my grandmother was not that strict on religion but she is very religious and always says that we should put God first always, whether in good or</p>
                <p>bad conditions. I remember most rainy seasons, she would say that the rain is nothing to stop us from going to church, It is just Satan playing with our heads and</p>
                <p>we should go to church and prove him wrong. So I can say that I really related a lot to this book. I also like how Patricia raised Trevor, in the way where she would buy him</p>
                <p>books and tell him to write things down from a very young age. This was a really good tactic because by the time Trevor was a Teenager, He had very good vocabulary</p>
                <p>and he had a shelf of all the books he had read.</p>

            <h1>Respond to this quote:</h1>
            <h3>”Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife…but he never fell in love with a</h3>
            <h3>traditional women…’He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a</h3>
            <h3>cage.’”</h3>
            <p>Abel never got the traditional marriage that he wanted because the woman he fell in</p>
            <p>love with was not subservient and his dream to put her in a cage backfired.</p>
            <p>In today's society, there are still some people that resonate to this quote where wives</p>
            <p>are to stay home, do all the household chores, have and take care of children and</p>
            <p>listen to the husband and do as he pleases. An example is this lady in my community</p>
            <p>who was having 3 children, doing all household chores and always listening to what</p>
            <p>the husband says. She did not like her life but also said that she cannot leave him</p>
            <p>claiming that she loves him and can do anything for him. Her husband is nothing</p>
            <p>different from Abel but as they say “Love is blind”.</p>
